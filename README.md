# In The Dark

A mobile game developed with React Native and Expo.

## üöÄ About The Project

"In The Dark" is a local multiplayer social deduction game designed to be played on a single mobile device. Players are secretly assigned to one of two teams: "In the Loop" or "In the Dark."

*   Players "In the Loop" are informed of a secret item belonging to a pre-selected category. All players in this group know the same item.
*   Players "In the Dark" do not know the secret item.

The game proceeds with players asking each other questions.
*   Players "In the Dark" must try to answer convincingly, bluffing as if they know the item.
*   Players "In the Loop" must answer truthfully but vaguely enough to avoid revealing the item to those "In the Dark."

The objectives are:
*   For players "In the Loop": To identify who is "In the Dark" without giving away the secret item.
*   For players "In the Dark": To deduce the secret item by the end of the game and avoid being identified.

The app utilizes a dark theme for its user interface and is built with React Native and Expo.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

*   [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
*   [Expo](https://expo.dev/) (SDK ~53)
*   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (Native Stack)

## üé≤ Core Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Team Assignment:** Players are secretly divided into "In the Loop" and "In the Dark" teams.
*   **Secret Item:** A secret item from a chosen category is revealed only to the "In the Loop" team.
*   **Question & Answer Phase:** Players take turns asking and answering questions.
*   **Deduction & Bluffing:** "In the Dark" players try to blend in, while "In the Loop" players try to identify them.
*   **Winning Conditions:**
    *   "In the Dark" players win if they correctly guess the item or remain undetected.
    *   "In the Loop" players win if they identify all "In the Dark" players before the item is guessed or if the "In the Dark" players fail to guess the item.
*   **Local Multiplayer:** Designed for a group of 3 or more people playing together on one device.
