- Always read the markdown file in a specific folder if it exists before looking at any other file in that folder or beginning work in that folder.
- Check corresponding markdown files and update them accordingly with any local changes that were made.
- Check the terminology.md file for relevant terminology for this project.
- When a folder gets sufficiently complex or large enough create a markdown file and list any relevant information.
